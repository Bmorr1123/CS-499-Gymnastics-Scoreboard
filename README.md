# CS-499-Gymnastics-Scoreboard

## Environment Setup
We will be using the following tools:
```
python 3.12.x
mysql (version tbd)
```

In addition, the `requirements.txt` file contains the Python Packages that we are using. The version should be specified for any new package installed.

### Requirements.txt breakdown

#### Packages:
- PyQt5 - Our GUI Library

#### Ideas:
- We should look into using a Python Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library such as SQLAlchemy to make our Database easy to work in. Read more about it [here](https://code.likeagirl.io/using-data-classes-to-create-database-models-in-python-b936301aa4ad).
- We should use a testing library like PyTest.

## Git Repository Rules
All changes should be merged into the `main` branch using a pull request. One approval is required, ideally from someone other that the person who wrote the code. The review does not need to be super in depth.

This will help us make sure our code is good.

### Branches
- We should try to name our branches based on what we are working on.
    >**For Example:** My first branch name is `bm/repo-setup`. `bm` for Ben Morrison, and `repo-setup` because that's what I was doing.
